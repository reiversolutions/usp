# The sunshine and gloom

> They say the world around us is beautiful. The world around us is a nightmare. It just depends on how you view the 
> world.
>   - Thomas Hutchinson, Druid of the cardboard box found in an alley on 4th street

For normal mundane people the world isn't a fairy tale but most people can enjoy their life and appreciate the beauty 
in the world. Those with _Universally Shared Psychosis_ (USP) see the real picture. How each day is a fight just to 
stay alive. How with their gift they must stop the darkness from seeping through into everyday life.

Those with __USP__ are usually found on the fringes of society, their mind seemingly broken by conventional standards.

## What is USP?

In order to understand Universally Shared Psychosis first we must understand its distant cousin, Shared Psychosis.

> Shared Psychosis, refereed to in the psychology field as _Folie a deaux_. Meaning "Madness of two" in French. Is a 
> psychological illness that occurs between two people that share a similar delusion. The couple in question are 
> usually close and rely on each other. Generally speaking one of them is dominant and the other passive. When the 
> dominant individual develops a psychological problem eventually over time the passive person starts to exhibit the 
> same symptoms. 
>
> An example of this could be that the dominant subject truly believes that he had a less than comfortable experience 
> with Aliens and to cope is now agoraphobic. His counterpart, being passive will stay in doors to comfort him and 
> eventually start to become agoraphobic for the same reasons.
> 
> Removing the individual that is mentally competent away on many occasions will cure them of the symptoms they now 
> have and they will return to a normal life. The other member of the couple will then proceed through normal 
> psychological methods in order to help them understand their infliction.
>
>   - An extract from the Journal of Psychology

USP is not entirely like most cases of Shared Psychosis and differs for the following reasons;

 1. All delusions recorded with suffers of Shared Psychosis are individual, some people may detail similar cases but 
 they have their differences. Universally Shared Psychosis on the other hand is entirely the same delusion. Scientists 
 are yet to find the reason for this but believe that it has to do with a common similarity in the environment that 
 modifies their current mental state. The illness being drug endued has been ruled out.
 2. Suffers of Universally Shared Psychosis remain in the same psychological state even when they are removed from the 
 rest of the group implying that they do not rely on someone else's symptoms to be triggered.

# Chatting with insanity

Just because the players are crazy doesn't mean they can't communicate with languages used by regular people, it 
simply means they have a few more of there own. Most are a variant of gibberish but some you may see every so often
and misinterpret them as not a complex form of communication.

> These languages are fully intended to be complete nonsense built on how people that are completely insane may see 
> the world. The crazy man in the street mumbling to himself maybe just using his native tongue and the girls chatting 
> on the bus might be using so much slang that they aren't seen as talking in English. Do you have a friend that tries 
> to use another language every time you go to a restaurant from a certain culture and is obviously talking nonsense 
> to the waiter? That's now a language, you've just spoke Gibberish (Italian) for example.

All players start out with one language that is there natural language, if a player wants their character to talk in 
another tongue, which isn't uncommon. You will need to add a dice to the _WIT_ skill _Language_. Each extra 
dice teaches them another language.

## Gibberish

The main voice of insanity comes in the form of __Gibberish__. Although there are many variants of the language, each
_accent_ understands another. 

> For example someone speaking Gibberish(Chinese) can understand and converse with someone speaking Gibberish(Crazy).
 
The different accents of Gibberish are usually stereotypes of what other languages sound like but also involve general
gibberish and made up languages.

## Interpretive Dance

Not all information can be explained easily. For those that don't have a common tongue there is the possibility of 
using sign language or diagrams but nothing translates simpler that interpretive dance. There isn't many mediums to 
which urgency and understanding can be displayed so purely.

## Nose Talk

The communication of fluffy rabbits... and rodents alike. As well as other animals that seem to talk through the 
movement of their noses.

This language breaks down barriers between mankind and the animals found around us. Many shadow walkers also use this 
as a means of communication due to its silence and the amount of knowledge the common rat knows about its surroundings.

It is also the the language of most wisps if they choose to communicate at all.

## Street

__Street__ isn't actually too far from _Gibberish_. The only difference is that it is one of the few language spoke by
USP suffers that normal people can almost understand. Street is actually just extreme overuse of slang but can be very
difficult to understand to other players that don't speak it. 

This language is specialised so if your character speaks Street (Teenage Girl) and you want to talk with someone who 
is speaking Street(Leetspeak), you will also have to learn that language too.

## Ultrasound

This language is so high pitched that only certain animals, such as dogs and those fluent in it can hear it. 
Realistically though it seems these people may just be really good a lip reading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Coping strategies 

Every once in awhile the shock of reality sinks back in and you realise what you life has become. There are many ways 
this can be handled but with the lack of professional support, people with USP usually rely on a particular way of 
coping. One that usually in the long run isn't good for them.

Players need to give their character one coping strategy. This can be anything the player wants but it should come with 
some negative drawback. Bellow is a list of suitable coping strategies for those suffering from USP.

## Alcohol

> You won't find your problems at the bottom of a bottle and that's why I drink. I wasn't looking for my problems in 
the first place.
>   - Philip Ward, "Regular" at the King's Head

Alcohol, the nectar of the gods. At the bottom of a few pints your worries start to fade away and you start to feel 
invincible. Your judgement is inebriated and slowly you remember that this life is the price you pay for the honour of 
protecting mankind. Where as most would expect fame and fortune, you take the noble path.

## Hallucinogens

One of the quickest ways to get back on the horse and escape from reality. Hallucinogens, usually a specific one, are 
what calm you down and before long you're back to seeing the strange things you normally do plus a few more.

## Painkillers

Painkillers such as Morphine can become very addictive but give a bliss like state to the user while damping the pain 
receptors in nerve endings. Once you've calmed down you gain a zen like view of the world and you are back on your way 
to defend the world from evil.

## Sedatives

> There's nothing to worry about when your dreaming. Its not like the real world.
>   - "Drowsy" Pete, Keeper of the shadows in Anchorage Way

Ever heard of the expression "You'll feel better in the morning". That morning comes along quicker when you pop some 
pills. The problem is that when USP suffers are sleeping they are most vulnerable from things that are real and the 
things they perceive as real.

## Self harm

> The sun god shines on me but when I fail I must beat the sin out of my body.
>   - Memoirs of martyr St Larry

A very severe way of coping. This should not be taken as a coping strategy lightly. You inflict harm on your body. 
Maybe its that you feel you have repented enough by injuring yourself and you get on with your life or maybe the pain 
caused distracts you long enough that you slip back into USP.

## Solitary 

Sometimes you just wish you could hide from the world. After some time and thought alone the voices you're used to kick 
in and all is right again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Delusional tendencies

Although you can modify the powers found in the __Mini-Six__ core book, bellow you can find some more specific powers
for the setting.


## Delusion: Impossible dodge

TN: 23
Duration: Instant
Range: Self
Resisted: None

Affect: You dodge with impeccable speed that normal mortals would be hit by.

Bullets are no match for your dodging prowess, you simply twitch to the side gracefully before they reach you.

> Deep in the delusion any ranged attacks with a quick weapon or spell seem to miss as you dodge, in reality you are 
> making weird jerking movements towards nothing.


## Delusion: Forceful push

TN: 15 + Resist roll
Duration: Instant
Range: 150 feet
Resisted: Might

Affect: A forceful gale force wind seems to push the opponent back.

Like a martial arts master of legend your quick movements of body and soul cause pressure in the atmosphere to push 
your enemies away with force.

> The user makes push movements with their hands towards something.


## Delusion: Slow time

TN: 23
Duration: Concentration
Range: Self
Resisted: None

Affect: Time is slowed for a short period of time.

Time seems to stand still and you react to your environment.

> The suffer of USP moves about slowly, acting like slow motion but in their reality they have slowed everything down


## Delusion: The Weaponsmith

TN: 15
Duration: Instant
Range: Self
Resisted: Might

Affect: You can find weapons all around you.

This delusion warps the suffers view of reality to the point that they can pick up objects and believe they are a 
weapon of mass power.

> Where a passer bye sees a tramp with a banana and a tube of tooth paste. The homeless man sees a laser gun and a gel 
> sword that morphs into what ever the user wills.



## Creating your own delusional powers

You can easily make any power you wish you're USP suffer to have. Remember that all powers are dictated by the fact 
that they are completely a delusion, and therefore do not work on normal people.

> For example a levitate delusion may make the player feel like he is hovering above the ground when in real life he 
> is just making noises and is firmly on the floor.
> On the other hand a flying delusion is very unlikely to work in this setting due to the fact that you jumping off a 
> building will cause you to fall to your death.

# People to talk too and people to hit

The players live in the real world and as such there are people to meet, animals to talk too and supernatural 
creatures to fend off. This section will go through the three main antagonists of USP. The _Twisted norms_, normal 
people and animals as seen through a suffers eyes. _Supernatural_ beings and other troubled _USP suffers_.


## The Twisted norms

Animals and people fall under this category. They are the normal antagonists that intersect with the players on a 
daily basis but show their true colours. Normal people aren't a worry usually, as they try to keep their distance 
anyway. On the other hand animals are a whole different problem.

### Average Human

Might: 2d    Wit: 2d    Agility: 2d    Charm: 2d

Skills: Any three at +1d each.
Gear: As needed by profession.
Static: Dodge 6, Soak 6

Your average joe, not a threat at all but may make for some great conversation, if they can understand what you're
rambling on about.

### Cat

Might: 2d    Wit: 0d    Agility: 2d+1    Charm: 1d

Skills: Brawling 2d+1, Stealth 4d+2
Static: Dodge 11, Soak 6

Cats are cunning schemers but very elegant. 

### Dog

Might: 2d    Wit: 0d    Agility: 2d+1    Charm: 1d

Skills: Lang(Ultrasound), Brawling 3d+2, Dodge: 3d+1
Static: Dodge 7, Soak 6

Man's best friend. Loyal but stubborn to the bone if you're not its master.

### Rats

Might: 2d    Wit: 0d    Agility: 2d+1    Charm: 1d

Skills: Lang(Ultrasound), Brawling 3d+2, Dodge: 3d+1
Static: Dodge 4, Soak 3

Dirty informants and always gossiping with a bit of a drinking problem.

## Supernatural

They are the creatures that plague humanity. The USP suffers are the ones to protect people from these beings.

A lot of the time its hard to tell if these creatures are completely an illusion or something real. There should be 
very little time for moral decision making though when players encounter one of these monsters. Supernatural beings 
have powers of there own and can cause not only problems for the players but also the surrounding area.

Burst pipes and burning buildings don't just happen on their own, although usually the police like to make people 
think arson was involved.

### Devil (Minor)

Skills: Brawling 5d, Dodge 4d+2, Persuasion 7d, Seduce 6d

    Sorcerer.

    Insubstantial (can only be harmed by magic or enchanted weapons; uses Wit in place of Might to resist and deal 
        damage);

        way rises as a vampire the next night.)
Complication: 
    Weakness to Sunlight (the vampire suffers a -2d to all rolls and -6 to all Static combat scores while in direct 
        sunlight.)
    Stake through the heart (targeting a vampire’s heart with a wooden stake adds 25 to the TN to hit but kills it 
        instantly.)
Static: Dodge 19, Block 15, Parry 10, Soak 10

### Werewolf

Might: 4d    Wit: 1d+2    Agility: 3d+2    Charm: 2d

### Zombie

Might: 3d    Wit: 0d    Agility: 2d    Charm: 0d

Static: Dodge 6, Block 9, Parry 9, Soak 9

## Other USP suffers

Due to them having a common understanding for the pain they have to go through not many people with USP fight between 
each other but sometimes it can't be helped. Maybe a supernatural entity has bewitched them or a Healer has induced a 
drug fuelled rage.

Whatever the reason, they are very difficult opponents as its like fighting a mirror. They have the same ability to 
confront the delusions and use them to their advantage which can be dangerous in the wrong hands.

# Game master advice

## Separating fact from fiction

In order to separate what is a delusion from what is actually happening it is recommended you use two very distinct 
ways of describing a situation. By default we recommend that you describe __reality in a cheerful way__ and anything 
part of __USP like a Noir film__. These two styles are very distinct and makes it simple for players to differentiate. 

> It is also wise to encourage your players to follow the same descriptive style you choose.

USP is by default played in a dark setting but there is no reason why reality can't be murky and their delusion some 
what fanatical.

## Player developed delusions

It is suggested that you involve the players as much as possible when creating the delusion they see. For many non plot 
related aspects explain what is really happening and then let a random player describe what they see. This won't be 
helpful sometimes as you may want them completely engrossed in the delusion but will be a nice way for them to develop 
the more mundane aspects of the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Blurb

Universally shared psychosis follows the poor unfortunate souls that are burden with the illness by the same name. 

As reality collapse all around them, showing the world for how it really is, these defenders of humanity must fend off 
the delusions from entering this world. Suffering from not viewing the bright and beautiful, they see a dark universe 
where all kind of nightmares exist. 

Using the __Mini-Six__ system and inspired by the works of __H.P. Lovecraft__, _as well as the Call of Cthulhu series_, 
players become a suffer of Universally Shared Psychosis and join the fight. Where others fear the delusions, you have 
embraced it and gained powers of your own to warp your view of reality.
